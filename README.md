## Features
- User can type in a query and display a list of books matching that query.
- Each item in the list should include the book's:
    - author
    - title
    - publishing company
    - a picture of the book
    - Link to more information about the book
        - could be on a page within your application
        - or link out to an external site

## Approach to Solution
- Simplfy requirements
- Research Google Books API
    - Learn how to interact with it
        > I'm looking for a JavaScript interface that does not need a server-side code
        
        > If unavailable, I'll use node.js to connect with the API

# Clarafications
- What field can a query search e.g. author, title, publishing company, and etc.
- Does the query search all of Google Books API or is it limited to the User's (My Library) data
